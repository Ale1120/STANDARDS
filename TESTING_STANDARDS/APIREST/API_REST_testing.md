#For effective testing, 5 main elements should be in place. These are:

- A good test strategy that defines the types and amount of testing

- A test plan that indicates the tasks to be done to implement the test strategy

- Test cases with detailed usage examples that will be used to check that the software meets the requirements

- Test data definition, that includes both input data and existing “production like” data, used during the test execution activities;

- Test environment where the application to be tested is deployed, and where testing cycles are carried out without external interference that may impact testing activities.


If one of these elements is missing, testing efficiency will be dramatically reduced.

#Just keep in mind that every test case has the following attributes:

- Title

- Understandable description

- Assumptions and/or pre-conditions

- A set of test steps

- Test data to be used to execute the functionality

- Expected result

All information should be simple and precise. Keep test cases as simple and small as possible.

Understand that having large numbers of small test cases is usually better than having small numbers of large test cases, because large test cases tend to become very difficult to maintain.

#With an API test suite in place with your Continuous Integration you can easily:

- Test all of your endpoints no matter where they are hosted, from AWS Lambda to your local machine
- Quickly ensure all of your services are running as expected
- Confirm that all of your endpoints are secured from unauthorized AND unauthenticated users
- Watch your test executions “magically” populate in your test management tool
